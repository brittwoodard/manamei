  heading: Discover the essence of Mana Movement
  description_html: >-
    <p>For centuries, cultures around the world have used dance as a way to pray, celebrate, express, and connect. When the energy that naturally moves through the body is expressed through intentional movement, it has the capacity to reconnect us with our own Source energy and power of manifestation.</p><p>This is a practice that, in mainstream culture has been lost.</p><p>We have become disconnected from the wisdom that we each innately hold in our bodies. We have become disconnected from the knowledge of how to use dance to pray, call in, and manifest what we desire in life.</p><p>But just because we have drifted away from these practices does not mean they have been lost forever!</p><p>This knowledge still lives inside each of us, waiting to be reactivated and used for its purpose- to bring us into align with our highest expression of life.</p><p>Using movement as a ritual practice can be done by absolutely anyone. There is no skill required. The only element necessary is a willingness to open to the unseen realm of energy, and to prioritize creating time and space to be fully present with your self, your feeling body, and all of the vibrations flowing through you.</p><p>Once we learn to tap into the river of energy flowing inside, welcoming it in every form- from the most gentle drips to the 10 foot high crashing waves- then we can learn to harness this power, activate it, and direct it through the body in a way that supports us stepping more fully into our power.</p><p>We become the masters of our reality, knowing that what is outside is a direct reflection of that is happening on the inside.</p>
who-its-for:
  heading: Mana Ritual Movement is for women who are ready to
  description_html: Unlock their full creative potential by accessing the well of life force energy flowing within.</p><p>Realign with a life filled with inspiration, beauty, pleasure, and flow.</p><p>Establish an unwavering sense of peace and safety within, no matter what is happening in the world around.</p><p>Rise into their full embodied power and live a life of liberated personal expression.</p><p>Cultivate deeper self love, confidence, and worthiness.</p><p>Become more comfortable dancing and moving their body freely.</p><p>Gain more fluidity, mobility, and awareness of their body in motion.</p><p>Learn a modality of practice that covers all three aspects of holistic healing, mindfulness meditation, physical body activation, spiritual liberation.

    <p>You have the flexibility to incorporate this program into your daily life. You may choose to engage with these modules every day or practice whenever inspiration strikes. The course is structured with 6 core modules and 4 supplementary modules. Each of the initial six modules delves into the intricacies of a segment within the Mana Movement Practice. Module 6 represents the comprehensive Mana Movement practice. The preceding five modules systematically break down each section. By progressing step by step, you can learn and embody these practices. By the time you reach Module 6, you will have already internalized all these movements, enabling a more profound exploration.</p><p>For optimal results, it is recommended to complete each module two to three times before advancing to the next one. This is your opportunity to fully embody these practices, allowing you to perform them effortlessly and immerse yourself in your unique experience. Upon completing the program, the aim is for you to autonomously practice without relying on the videos, as you will have developed a profound familiarity with the movements within your body.</p>

  heading: Frequently asked questions
  questions-and-answers:
    - question: I have a busy schedule. Can I take my time working through each module?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>YES! There is no strict timeline for this program, and upon purchase, you gain lifetime access to the material.</p>
    - question: Are there prerequisites to take this program?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>NO. This program is open to any woman who is excited and ready to
        dive into the movement medicine, regardless of your previous experience.
        All women can benefit from this program, regardless of your age,
        physical capacity, dance experience, or location in the world.</p>
    - question: What is the difference between Wisdom Body and MANA Movement?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>MANA Movement is a guided practice which flows through sequences of
        specific movement patterns that are focused on bringing non-linear
        movement into the physical body, otherwise known as the Feminine
        Pathways or circles, spirals, and waves.</p><p>MANA Movement is a great
        place to start for those who are completely new to embodied dance and
        want clear and specific guidance on how to move the body for more
        freedom.</p><p>Wisdom Body will offer you the next level of freedom in
        that there is no specific guided movements, but rather invitations for
        you to discover your unique movement style through intentional prompts,
        imagery, and somatic cues.</p><p class="mb-4">Wisdom Body is perfect for any woman
        ready to deepen her movement practice and gain new inspiration for
        increased freedom.</p><div class=”youtube-container”>

    - question: Will I receive a certificate at the end?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Mana Movement is purely a personal deep dive experience so there is no
        certification at completion. If you are interested in Mana Mei’s Level 1
