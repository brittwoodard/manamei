   - testimonial: I am basking in the pleasure of being a woman. Working with Mana Mei was a profound, transformative, deep passage of giving myself permission to stand in my power and take full responsibility for my life. Mana’s work is potent medicine and receiving it is a big gift…This is the path of the Divine Feminine, of us awakening to be whole and complete, and this in the medicine that gives you the opportunity to step into your wholeness.
     author: Ela Gasiorowska
   - testimonial: I can say with confidence that this work changed my life. Anything Mana touches is imbued with deep love and reverence for the feminine, and this was no exception. Words are really hard to find to describe this work, this medicine, this ancient wisdom that is ignited within your body when you do this movement.
     author: 
   - testimonial: My body feels activated and strong. I am more aware of how I hold my body and how I move in day to day life. I feel more present more often, in deeper communication with my Soul. Life is now more expansive, more abundant in opportunities, my creativity feels like it flipped a switch and now theres a flood of ideas and inspiration. I feel dedicated to myself and creating my life around this passion for creating art with my body and inspiring others to do the same. I feel closer to the possibility of stepping into my leadership with confidence in what I have to offer! I feel more accepting and self loving for all emotional energies that want to be experienced through me, allowing freedom of expression. And i feel empowered in knowing that i always have this temple space within.
     author: 
   - testimonial: These rituals of presence and movement allowed me to feel what I had been resisting to feel, to witness the subconscious self sabotaging beliefs and to actively make choices to alchemise them through my movement in these delicious feminine patterns. Through the activations, alot of the ptsd that had been stored in my body and spine had a chance to finally be released.<br class="mb-4">This brought with it, a deep shamanic journey to the depths of the shadows I had collected in this life, along with the karmic and generational wounded energies that I had been holding on to. I learnt what it means to embody it all, the light and the dark, the love and the fear, to become an embodied woman learning to welcome all with loving presence. I met so many fragmanted parts of my being that had been hiding away, some days I felt ecstaticly empowered, basking in liberation, and others days where I felt frozen in resistance to moving or feeling anything at all. Yet having these practices as a constant, and the specific sets of delicious, nourishing movements, linked with the presence of the breath was sooooo healing, where I could just surrender to Mana’s voice and the beautiful was she leads the practices.

  heading: Frequently asked questions
  questions-and-answers: 
   - question: I have a busy schedule. Can I take my time working through each module?
     answer_html: <p>YES! Wisdom Body is designed to serve YOU in living in your radiance. Therefore the practices have been designed to give you the freedom of when, and how often you practice. That being said here is the recommendation from Mana Mei.</p><p>For first time, it is recommended to complete ONE module per week, spacing the 3 practices out as you desire. The practices are meant to do IN ORDER, as the 3rd practice incorporates practice 1 & 2.</p><p>As you have lifetime access, once you have completed all 4 modules, you will have the knowledge and freedom to revisit specific practices, choosing which will serve you best on any particular day.</p><p>These practices are meant to be done MORE THAN ONCE. And the more you do them, the deeper you will be able to go. Through the practices, you are retraining your ability to stay present, to access more freedom, and to evoke new feelings.</p>
   - question: Are there prerequisites to take this program?
     answer_html: <p>NO. This program is open to any woman who is excited and ready to dive into the movement medicine, regardless of your previous experience. All women can benefit from this program, regardless of your age, physical capacity, dance experience, or location in the world.</p><p>In the case that you are still worried that you do not have enough experience for this program, Mana Mei recommends starting with the MANA Movement Program as a solid starting foundation.</p>
   - question: What is the difference between Wisdom Body and MANA Movement?
     answer_html: <p>MANA Movement is a guided practice which flows through sequences of specific movement patterns that are focused on bringing non-linear movement into the physical body, otherwise known as the Feminine Pathways or circles, spirals, and waves.</p><p>MANA Movement is a great place to start for those who are completely new to embodied dance and want clear and specific guidance on how to move the body for more freedom.</p><p>Wisdom Body will offer you the next level of freedom in that there is no specific guided movements, but rather invitations for you to discover your unique movement style through intentional prompts, imagery, and somatic cues.</p><p class="mb-4">Wisdom Body is perfect for any woman ready to deepen her movement practice and gain new inspiration for increased freedom.</p><div class=”youtube-container”>

   - question: Will I receive a certificate at the end?
     answer_html: <p>Wisdom Body is purely a personal deep dive experience so there is no certification at completion. If you are interested in Mana Mei’s Level 1 Leadership and Facilitator Training, check out the Liberation Through Movement Mentorship Program!</p>
   - question: I don’t have a credit card. Is there any other way I can pay?
     answer_html: <p>If you do not have a Credit Card, you can alternatively pay through PayPal. In order to do this, you will need to send the full amount to paypal.me/manamovement and contact Mana through email or Social Media with your name, email, and which program you have purchased.</p>

  heading: Something greater
  description_html: <p>There is something much greater than you or me, or our physical bodies and minds, that exists in the unseen world and is the source of what we call magic, and which is always working to bring us back into alignment with our divine path and purpose - that something is your Wisdom Body.</p><p>This immersion will provide you with the tools & experiences to help you reconnect with your own Wisdom Body and step into your full power.</p>
