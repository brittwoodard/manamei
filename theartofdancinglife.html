  heading: What is the The Art of Dancing Life?
  description_html: >-
    <p>Wouldn’t it be so cool to wake up every single day and be able to think to yourself, <em>“Damn, I’m doing this whole LIFE thing really good.”</em>?</p>
    <p>Living life to its fullest and creating a satisfying experience for yourself is an ART. The facets of your Life journey must be crafted and curated with <strong>attention & intention</strong>. This finely curated masterpiece of life can only be achieved through a deep level of AWARENESS, not only to your outer environment, but also, first and foremost to your <strong>INNER LANDSCAPE</strong>.</p>
    <p>Then, we use the <strong>BODY</strong> as a vessel to bridge the potential of our inner wonderland into the lived experience of our outer world- manifested through our actions,  movements, words, and moment-to-moment choices. Through meeting life in this way, choosing from felt-body awareness at every breath, life unfolds into a radiant <span class="font-serif text-[1.5rem]">dance</span>. We feel, then we move. We breathe, then we respond. Swaying and undulating to the luscious rhythm of our Heart and the melody of our awakened Spirit.</p>
