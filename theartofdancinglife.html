    <p>Wouldn’t it be so cool to wake up every single day and be able to think to yourself, <em>“Damn, I’m doing this whole LIFE thing really good.”</em>?</p>
    <p>Living life to its fullest and creating a satisfying experience for yourself is an ART. The facets of your Life journey must be crafted and curated with <strong>attention & intention</strong>. This finely curated masterpiece of life can only be achieved through a deep level of AWARENESS, not only to your outer environment, but also, first and foremost to your <strong>INNER LANDSCAPE</strong>.</p>
    <p>Then, we use the <strong>BODY</strong> as a vessel to bridge the potential of our inner wonderland into the lived experience of our outer world- manifested through our actions,  movements, words, and moment-to-moment choices. Through meeting life in this way, choosing from felt-body awareness at every breath, life unfolds into a radiant <span class="font-serif text-[1.5rem]">dance</span>. We feel, then we move. We breathe, then we respond. Swaying and undulating to the luscious rhythm of our Heart and the melody of our awakened Spirit.</p>

    <p>You have the flexibility to incorporate this program into your daily life. You may choose to engage with these modules every day or practice whenever inspiration strikes. The course is structured with 6 core modules and 4 supplementary modules. Each of the initial six modules delves into the intricacies of a segment within the Mana Movement Practice. Module 6 represents the comprehensive Mana Movement practice. The preceding five modules systematically break down each section. By progressing step by step, you can learn and embody these practices. By the time you reach Module 6, you will have already internalized all these movements, enabling a more profound exploration.</p><p>For optimal results, it is recommended to complete each module two to three times before advancing to the next one. This is your opportunity to fully embody these practices, allowing you to perform them effortlessly and immerse yourself in your unique experience. Upon completing the program, the aim is for you to autonomously practice without relying on the videos, as you will have developed a profound familiarity with the movements within your body.</p>

  heading: Frequently asked questions
  questions-and-answers:
    - question: I have a busy schedule. Can I take my time working through each module?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>YES! There is no strict timeline for this program, and upon purchase, you gain lifetime access to the material.</p>
    - question: Are there prerequisites to take this program?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>NO. This program is open to any woman who is excited and ready to
        dive into the movement medicine, regardless of your previous experience.
        All women can benefit from this program, regardless of your age,
        physical capacity, dance experience, or location in the world.</p>
    - question: What is the difference between Wisdom Body and MANA Movement?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>MANA Movement is a guided practice which flows through sequences of
        specific movement patterns that are focused on bringing non-linear
        movement into the physical body, otherwise known as the Feminine
        Pathways or circles, spirals, and waves.</p><p>MANA Movement is a great
        place to start for those who are completely new to embodied dance and
        want clear and specific guidance on how to move the body for more
        freedom.</p><p>Wisdom Body will offer you the next level of freedom in
        that there is no specific guided movements, but rather invitations for
        you to discover your unique movement style through intentional prompts,
        imagery, and somatic cues.</p><p class="mb-4">Wisdom Body is perfect for any woman
        ready to deepen her movement practice and gain new inspiration for
        increased freedom.</p><div class=”youtube-container”>

    - question: Will I receive a certificate at the end?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Mana Movement is purely a personal deep dive experience so there is no
        certification at completion. If you are interested in Mana Mei’s Level 1
        Leadership and Facilitator Training, check out the <a class="hyperlink" href="/liberation-through-movement-mentorship.html">Liberation Through
        Movement Mentorship</a> Program!</p>
    - question: I don’t have a credit card. Is there any other way I can pay?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Yes! We accept PayPal and Bank Transfers. Please contact Mana Mei to
        request a new payment option.</p>

    <p>Doing life really good doesn’t mean that we never meet challenges or have conflict, or that we never feel pain or disruption. Doing life really good means that we feel empowered to always bring ourself back to a sense of safety and freedom, no matter what life is throwing our way- to have agency (authority) over our own experience, inner and outer, and to stay firmly rooted in the driver’s seat of our life.</p>
