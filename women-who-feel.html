    <p>Safe in your Body, Safe in your emotions, Safe in the World & Free in your Body, Free in your Emotions, Free in the World… Then you are not alone.</p>

    <p>If you are a woman who (sometimes) feels…</p>
    <p>And if these words resonate with you, then you are probably also a woman who feels…</p>
