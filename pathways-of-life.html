    <p>We are energy expressing itself through the physical body. This is our life force energy and our innate source of power. This abundant, never-ending source of energy flows through us in non-linear pathways of circles, spirals, waves, also known as the FEMININE PATHWAYS.</p>
    <p>The very same patterns can be observed in nature, from subatomic to electrical bodies, proving that the same patterns work on both physiological and psychic levels for humans, emerging as the foundation of all of our existence in both the material and energetic world, affecting us at every level in the totality of our MIND-BODY-SPIRIT experience.</p>

  heading_html: Exploring the Feminine Shapes as a Pathway to Healing and Transformation
  description_html: >-
    <p>Understanding your personal connection to the Non-Linear Pathways will become a beacon of light guiding you in your personal journey of healing and transformation.</p>
    <p>Whatever meaningful changes you desire in your life, through the intentional self investigation into the Feminine Pathways of your own psyche and body, you will become empowered in your ability to meet these changes with presence and grace.</p>
    <p>There is no expectation to be perfect. Only to become aware of what lives within you and what needs to be witnessed and reassessed, released and expressed.</p>
    <p>Through creating a safe space and expertly held container of support and knowledge, you will have the tools and guidance to dance the courageous path of embodied self development.</p>

    ​​“Such a profoundly moving experience…the way this practice combined the embodied experience with the verbal, analytical awareness added such richness. Weaving in the awareness of the deeper meanings behind the circles, spirals, waves, and torus was incredible—like being given a map to something my body already knew but my mind had yet to name. Bringing the intention and the empowerment front and center made every movement feel even more purposeful, like a conversation between the ancient and the present moment.”

              <p>This 4-month journey is a time to turn your attention inwards, a time of introspection and connecting deeply with your inner landscape.</p>
              <p>Each month, you will be invited to devote yourself to your inner work, prioritize YOU and the process of awakening self awareness at all levels.</p>
              <p>You do this by committing to:</p>
              <ul class="mb-4 ml-4">
                <li>Daily pre-recorded embodied movement and somatic dance practices</li>
                <li>Weekly journaling prompts</li>
                <li>Weekly live group transmissions with Mana Mei & Guest Facilitators</li>
                <li>Monthly POD Support Calls</li>
                <li>1:1 Mentoring calls</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Stepping onto this path is stepping into a new way of being. One that prioritizes creating sacred space every day to dive into deep, uninterrupted, vulnerable presence with yourself.</p>
              <p>Months 1-3 consists of 3 weeks of content, and 1 week of integration.</p>
              <p>The Integration weeks are intended to be a time when you are free to replenish and nourish your self, catch up on missed lectures and practices, and prepare yourself to step into the next month.</p>
              <p>Month 4 is a focused training where you will learn to guide an LTM Embodied Dance Journey, as well as the ins-and-outs of Art of Embodied Space Holding & Authentic Facilitation.</p>
