     title: Connecting with the Feminine Way
     description_html: <p>Through movement practices focused on the Feminine Way, we can learn to soften and relax the body in the face of intense sensations- to open rather than close, to welcome rather than resist.</p><p>This will greatly support the ease of the birth process and our ability to experience pleasure and joy during the journey.</p>

  description_html: Needs a description, something that tells the visitor what they'll get or what they can expect. How many lessons? How long are they, or how much time will they need to dedicate to the program?  Is it a dip in and out whenever they feel like it?  Or was it designed to be completed over a x-week period?

  heading: Hi! I'm Mana Mei
  description_html: I am a professional dancer, performer, and International Leader in the Art of Feminine Embodiment. And above all else,</p><p><strong>I am mother.</strong></p><p>  Taking the Rite of Passage into motherhood was the most incredible, confronting, and transformational experience of my life. I am forever grateful to claim the Archetype of the Mother and witness how it continues to inspire everything I do.</p><p>  I am passionate about helping other women claim their Feminine Power through the language of dance. This is why I have created Liberation Through Movement - a lifestyle and personal transformation business that realigns women with their power to step forward as the ultimate creators of their lives through the modality of embodied dance and intentional movement.</p><p>  Through my life-long studies of classical dance techniques and over 10 years of exploring non-traditional movement techniques, I have discovered the immense healing power of movement and am passionate about sharing this wisdom with women all over the world.</p><p>I believe that our bodies are vessels built to explore all of the complexities of the human experience, and by becoming deeply embodied, we can cultivate unwavering inner safety and freedom, and engage in the world from this place, allows us to live in authentic liberation.

  heading: Do you TRUST your body?
  description_html: One of the biggest pains I see in the modern Birth Culture is the way women are disempowered- not feeling in control of their own experience, not feeling safe, and not feeling free.</p><p><strong>Safety & Freedom in your Birth journey starts inside...</strong></p><p><em>Do you TRUST your body?</p><p>Can you LISTEN to the subtle cues of your Body?</p><p>Are you connected to your intuition?</p><p>Do you have the tools to create or shift the energy within your body?</em></p><p>If we are not deeply connected to our own intuition, trust, and knowledge of how to create and shift our experience within our body, then we may be giving our power away, and there is no greater moment in a woman’s life when this could “make or break” an experience than during the BIRTH journey.
