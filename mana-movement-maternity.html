  description_html: I am a professional dancer, performer, and International Leader in the Art of Feminine Embodiment. And above all else,</p><p><strong>I am mother.</strong></p><p>  Taking the Rite of Passage into motherhood was the most incredible, confronting, and transformational experience of my life. I am forever grateful to claim the Archetype of the Mother and witness how it continues to inspire everything I do.</p><p>  I am passionate about helping other women claim their Feminine Power through the language of dance. This is why I have created Liberation Through Movement - a lifestyle and personal transformation business that realigns women with their power to step forward as the ultimate creators of their lives through the modality of embodied dance and intentional movement.</p><p>  Through my life-long studies of classical dance techniques and over 10 years of exploring non-traditional movement techniques, I have discovered the immense healing power of movement and am passionate about sharing this wisdom with women all over the world.</p><p>I believe that our bodies are vessels built to explore all of the complexities of the human experience, and by becoming deeply embodied, we can cultivate unwavering inner safety and freedom, and engage in the world from this place, allows us to live in authentic liberation.

  heading: Frequently asked questions
  questions-and-answers: 
   - question: At what stage of Pregnancy Can I do this course?
     answer_html: <p>This course has been designed to suit women at ANY stage of pregnancy. Within the course, Mana Mei offers modifications to support your changing body, comfort levels, and energy needs. These practices are also amazing for your post-partum recovery and healing time.</p><p>That being said, it is always recommended to listen to your body and respect what it needs. If you are unsure if any part of the practice is right for you, please consult your birthing professional.</p>
   - question: Can I do this course even if I am not pregnant or planning to become a mother?
     answer_html: <p>YES! As women, we are all creative beings. Whether you are birthing a baby, a project, an idea, or any other medium of creation, you can benefit from these practices as they will connect your with your innate creativity and the magic of your womb space.</p>
   - question: How often can I do these practices, and should I follow a certain order?
     answer_html: <p>Mana Movement is designed to be done as a daily, or regularly weekly practice. Because it is highly modifiable, you are welcome to practice as often as feels good to you! The most important part is to always listen to your body and what she needs on any given day. I would suggest doing the practice in order first, and then once you have completed all practices, you can choose which one you want to do each day.</p>
   - question: I donât have a credit card. Is there any other way I can pay?
     answer_html: <p>If you do not have a Credit Card, you can alternatively pay through PayPal. In order to do this, you will need to send the full amount to paypal.me/manamovement and contact Mana through email or Social Media with your name, email, and which program you have purchased.</p>

  heading: Do you Trust your Body?
  description_html: One of the biggest pains I see in the Birth Culture is the way in which women are disempowered by not feeling in control of their experience.</p><p>The way I see it, this starts inside of ourselves.</p><p>Do you TRUST your body?</p><p>Can you LISTEN to the subtle cues of your Body?</p><p>Are you connected to our intuition?</p><p>Do you have the tools to create or shift the energy inside your body?</p><p>If you answered NO to any of these questions, then there is work to be done!</p><p>If we are not deeply connected to our own intuition, trust, and knowledge of how to create and shift our experience within our body, then we may be giving our power away, and there is no greater moment in a womanâs life when this could âmake or breakâ an experience than BIRTH.</p><p>It is time to reclaim your Power! To Create a beautiful Rite of Passage into Motherhood, full of TRUST in your Feminine Wisdom and the magic of your Body.</p>
