    <p>You have the flexibility to incorporate this program into your daily life. You may choose to engage with these modules every day or practice whenever inspiration strikes. The course is structured with 6 core modules and 4 supplementary modules. Each of the initial six modules delves into the intricacies of a segment within the Mana Movement Practice. Module 6 represents the comprehensive Mana Movement practice. The preceding five modules systematically break down each section. By progressing step by step, you can learn and embody these practices. By the time you reach Module 6, you will have already internalized all these movements, enabling a more profound exploration.</p><p>For optimal results, it is recommended to complete each module two to three times before advancing to the next one. This is your opportunity to fully embody these practices, allowing you to perform them effortlessly and immerse yourself in your unique experience. Upon completing the program, the aim is for you to autonomously practice without relying on the videos, as you will have developed a profound familiarity with the movements within your body.</p>

  heading: Hi! I'm Mana Mei
  description_html: I am a professional dancer, performer, and International Leader in the Art of Feminine Embodiment. And above all else,</p><p><strong>I am mother.</strong></p><p>  Taking the Rite of Passage into motherhood was the most incredible, confronting, and transformational experience of my life. I am forever grateful to claim the Archetype of the Mother and witness how it continues to inspire everything I do.</p><p>  I am passionate about helping other women claim their Feminine Power through the language of dance. This is why I have created Liberation Through Movement - a lifestyle and personal transformation business that realigns women with their power to step forward as the ultimate creators of their lives through the modality of embodied dance and intentional movement.</p><p>  Through my life-long studies of classical dance techniques and over 10 years of exploring non-traditional movement techniques, I have discovered the immense healing power of movement and am passionate about sharing this wisdom with women all over the world.</p><p>I believe that our bodies are vessels built to explore all of the complexities of the human experience, and by becoming deeply embodied, we can cultivate unwavering inner safety and freedom, and engage in the world from this place, allows us to live in authentic liberation.

  heading: Do you TRUST your body?
  description_html: One of the biggest pains I see in the modern Birth Culture is the way women are disempowered- not feeling in control of their own experience, not feeling safe, and not feeling free.</p><p><strong>Safety & Freedom in your Birth journey starts inside...</strong></p><p><em>Do you TRUST your body?</p><p>Can you LISTEN to the subtle cues of your Body?</p><p>Are you connected to your intuition?</p><p>Do you have the tools to create or shift the energy within your body?</em></p><p>If we are not deeply connected to our own intuition, trust, and knowledge of how to create and shift our experience within our body, then we may be giving our power away, and there is no greater moment in a woman’s life when this could “make or break” an experience than during the BIRTH journey.
