    Humans are social creatures, we need each other. When we come together in
    community and shared passion, we help give each other the support,
    inspiration, and strength needed to align with our true nature, our
    radiance, and our ability to thrive.
     
    As women, it is our time to rise together. To remind each other that we are
    not alone in our journey. That we are worthy to be living lives filled with
    joy and unwavering peace. And that we can experience the growth we desire
    through creativity and pleasure- the feminine way.

  heading: Frequently asked questions
  questions-and-answers:
    - question: I have a busy schedule. Can I take my time working through each module?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>YES! Wisdom Body is designed to serve YOU in living in your radiance.
        Therefore the practices have been designed to give you the freedom of
        when, and how often you practice. That being said here is the
        recommendation from Mana Mei.</p><p>For first time, it is recommended to
        complete ONE module per week, spacing the 3 practices out as you desire.
        The practices are meant to do IN ORDER, as the 3rd practice incorporates
        practice 1 & 2.</p><p>As you have lifetime access, once you have
        completed all 4 modules, you will have the knowledge and freedom to
        revisit specific practices, choosing which will serve you best on any
        particular day.</p><p>These practices are meant to be done MORE THAN
        ONCE. And the more you do them, the deeper you will be able to go.
        Through the practices, you are retraining your ability to stay present,
        to access more freedom, and to evoke new feelings.</p>
    - question: Are there prerequisites to take this program?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>NO. This program is open to any woman who is excited and ready to
        dive into the movement medicine, regardless of your previous experience.
        All women can benefit from this program, regardless of your age,
        physical capacity, dance experience, or location in the world.</p><p>In
        the case that you are still worried that you do not have enough
        experience for this program, Mana Mei recommends starting with the MANA
        Movement Program as a solid starting foundation.</p>
    - question: What is the difference between Wisdom Body and MANA Movement?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>MANA Movement is a guided practice which flows through sequences of
        specific movement patterns that are focused on bringing non-linear
        movement into the physical body, otherwise known as the Feminine
        Pathways or circles, spirals, and waves.</p><p>MANA Movement is a great
        place to start for those who are completely new to embodied dance and
        want clear and specific guidance on how to move the body for more
        freedom.</p><p>Wisdom Body will offer you the next level of freedom in
        that there is no specific guided movements, but rather invitations for
        you to discover your unique movement style through intentional prompts,
        imagery, and somatic cues.</p><p>Wisdom Body is perfect for any woman
        ready to deepen her movement practice and gain new inspiration for
        increased freedom.</p>
    - question: Will I receive a certificate at the end?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Wisdom Body is purely a personal deep dive experience so there is no
        certification at completion. If you are interested in Mana Mei’s Level 1
        Leadership and Facilitator Training, check out the Liberation Through
        Movement Mentorship Program!</p>
    - question: I don’t have a credit card. Is there any other way I can pay?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Yes! We accept PayPal and Bank Transfers. Please contact Mana Mei to
        request a new payment option.</p>
