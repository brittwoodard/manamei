    Humans are social creatures, we need each other. When we come together in
    community and shared passion, we help give each other the support,
    inspiration, and strength needed to align with our true nature, our
    radiance, and our ability to thrive.
     
    As women, it is our time to rise together. To remind each other that we are
    not alone in our journey. That we are worthy to be living lives filled with
    joy and unwavering peace. And that we can experience the growth we desire
    through creativity and pleasure- the feminine way.

about: 
  heading: The story of Mana Mei & Liberation Through Movement
  description_html: In early 2020, the world began shutting down. Borders closed, neighborhoods closed, doors closed, and hearts began closing as people were forced to enter into a time of isolation and separateness… a sense of closeness, intimacy, and community greatly began suffering, and so did many people as they were left alone, stripped of the human connection that is so vital for our health and wellbeing.</p><p>But although this may sound like the start of a tragic story, it is not. Because as is the way of life, as some doors shut, others open. The rise of virtual global communities  began spreading like wildfire as people all over the world also rose up to meet the shifting paradigm. People everywhere began seeking like-minded, like-spirited tribe in every continent, uniting together under common interests and shared passions. And within the flow of this massive global movement to the virtual space, the Liberation Through Movement Tribe was born.</p><p>Mana Mei is an international feminine embodiment facilitator, sacred embodied ritual space creator, and muse of all things dance and movement. Her mission and passion on this Earth walk is to create experiences where women can come together in transformation and growth through the feminine arts. For women to find safety in sisterhood, and permission through collective support to be their most radiant and fully expressed badass creatrix selves.</p><p>And in early 2020, when the global movement to the virtual field ignited, another movement also sparked into existence… the LIBERATION THROUGH MOVEMENT.</p><p>Mana Mei birthed the Liberation Through Movement Tribe as a Facebook Group open to all women interested in dance, movement, embodiment, and global sisterhood. Her desire was to create a space where women could feel connected to other sisters around the world through the universal language of dance and embodiment, and remember that they are not alone. That even during a time of physical separateness, we are here to support one another, hold each other in tenderness through the challenges of life, and continue rising together, celebrating our feminine power, and reconnecting with embodied pleasure and authentic creative expression.</p><p>During 2020, the Liberation Through Movement Tribe grew from just a few hundred women, to over 3,000 women spanning every continent! Within the tribe, women cultivated trust in each other through vulnerable and authentic sharing, they explored different facets of their feminine expression through embodied dance experiences, they leaned into being seen and heard by their sisters, and they co-created a beautiful, thriving global tribe of rising women to inspire, be inspired, support, and be supported, through all of life’s twists and turns.</p><p><strong>For many women, the Liberation Through Movement Tribe BECAME HOME.</strong></p><p>But by the end of 2020, it was becoming very clear to Mana Mei that the Facebook platform was not in alignment with the core values of this tribe. Tribe members were getting their content censored, blocked, and their freedom of expression was stifled. Mana realized that the rules of Facebook went against everything the community stands for. That without FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, women would never fully thrive the way they deserve. So Mana made the very edgy decision to move the tribe off Facebook and rebirth the community on an independent platform where ownership of the community rested in the hands of Mana Mei and the members of the tribe.</p><p>Mana knew that stepping into this next evolution of Liberation Through Movement would require a deeper commitment to serving her community, and providing women with access to the knowledge and experiences needed to continue rising together in embodied sisterhood. This commitment comes in the  form of consistent offerings-  weekly opportunities for all members of the tribe to dive into new unique classes, workshops, and rituals all centered around feminine embodiment and cultivating creative expression. Through this consistency of showing up with and for each other, we are able to co-create a potent container to give us the strength we need to continue navigating life with grace and aligning ourselves with our highest potential as embodied feminine leaders.</p><p><em>Liberation Through Movement is a place to call home, where we value freedom of expression and the cultivation of embodied feminine power. This tribe was created for you, WELCOME HOME.</em></p>

  heading: Frequently asked questions
  questions-and-answers:
    - question: I have a busy schedule. Can I take my time working through each module?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>YES! Wisdom Body is designed to serve YOU in living in your radiance.
        Therefore the practices have been designed to give you the freedom of
        when, and how often you practice. That being said here is the
        recommendation from Mana Mei.</p><p>For first time, it is recommended to
        complete ONE module per week, spacing the 3 practices out as you desire.
        The practices are meant to do IN ORDER, as the 3rd practice incorporates
        practice 1 & 2.</p><p>As you have lifetime access, once you have
        completed all 4 modules, you will have the knowledge and freedom to
        revisit specific practices, choosing which will serve you best on any
        particular day.</p><p>These practices are meant to be done MORE THAN
        ONCE. And the more you do them, the deeper you will be able to go.
        Through the practices, you are retraining your ability to stay present,
        to access more freedom, and to evoke new feelings.</p>
    - question: Are there prerequisites to take this program?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>NO. This program is open to any woman who is excited and ready to
        dive into the movement medicine, regardless of your previous experience.
        All women can benefit from this program, regardless of your age,
        physical capacity, dance experience, or location in the world.</p><p>In
        the case that you are still worried that you do not have enough
        experience for this program, Mana Mei recommends starting with the MANA
        Movement Program as a solid starting foundation.</p>
    - question: What is the difference between Wisdom Body and MANA Movement?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>MANA Movement is a guided practice which flows through sequences of
        specific movement patterns that are focused on bringing non-linear
        movement into the physical body, otherwise known as the Feminine
        Pathways or circles, spirals, and waves.</p><p>MANA Movement is a great
        place to start for those who are completely new to embodied dance and
        want clear and specific guidance on how to move the body for more
        freedom.</p><p>Wisdom Body will offer you the next level of freedom in
        that there is no specific guided movements, but rather invitations for
        you to discover your unique movement style through intentional prompts,
        imagery, and somatic cues.</p><p>Wisdom Body is perfect for any woman
        ready to deepen her movement practice and gain new inspiration for
        increased freedom.</p>
    - question: Will I receive a certificate at the end?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Wisdom Body is purely a personal deep dive experience so there is no
        certification at completion. If you are interested in Mana Mei’s Level 1
        Leadership and Facilitator Training, check out the Liberation Through
        Movement Mentorship Program!</p>
    - question: I don’t have a credit card. Is there any other way I can pay?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Yes! We accept PayPal and Bank Transfers. Please contact Mana Mei to
        request a new payment option.</p>
