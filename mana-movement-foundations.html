  heading: Discover the essence of Mana Movement Foundations
  description: >-
    MANA Movement is a modality of movement that is focused on activating the
    non-linear pathways of energy and of physical movement through the body.
    These pathways are circles, spirals, and waves. These are also called the
    Feminine Pathways of Movement.


    The purpose of this practice is to bring our physical body and our energy
    body back into balance- where we hold a harmonious balance between the
    Masculine and the Feminine. The Masculine movement is linear, the feminine
    movement is non-linear. Because we live in a world where we primarily move
    and function from the Masculine, it is important for us to take the time to
    activate the Feminine in order to come back into harmonious balance.


    When we activate these Feminine pathways of movement through the body, we
    allow the natural flow of life force energy to move through us without
    restriction. This will allow us to access more creativity, more pleasure,
    more inspiration, more joy.


    It also allows us to meet life’s challenges with more peace and with more
    grace. It increases our capacity to, literally, flow with life. This will
    bring more ease into every single aspect of your life. 


    Through this practice, by simply focusing on bringing these circles and
    spirals and waves into every single part of your body, this will in turn
    benefit the way you move through life and the way you meet life in every
    single moment.

    <p>In this course, Mana Mei, founder of Liberation Through Movement- an
    international business focused on empowering women through embodied
    movement, will guide you through her signature life-changing movement
    meditation practice, MANA Movement. Through this practice, you will
    cultivate deep interoception (feeling body awareness) and learn to transmute
    all emotions through the physical body, helping you to regain agency over
    your life and ability to thrive.</p><p>In this Foundational MANA Movement
    course, you will gain access to TWO full length practices which will bring
    you into deep communion with your entire body, both physically and
    energetically.</p><p>Through the consistent practice of MANA Movement, you
    will strengthen your connection to self and cultivate an unwavering inner
    sanctuary filled with a sense of peace, safety, expansion, and
    freedom.</p><p>Each module includes a video introduction to explain the
    structure and concept of the practice, plus the full length video guided
    practice.&nbsp;</p>
  module:
    - title: Module 1
      description_html: >-
        <p>The first practice will take you through a thorough exploration of
        the foundational seated MANA Movement practice, focused on activating
        the central channel of the body from root to crown, through the spine,
        as well as opening the channels through the arms. You will be introduced
        to the breath-body connection and conscious breathing patterns used
        throughout the practice. You will also have moments to dive into your
        free movement exploration, discovering your own unique way of moving in
        circles, spirals, and waves.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The second practice is an evolution of practice one. In this
        practice, you will travel through all four body positions, moving from
        seated all the way to standing, and activating the Feminine Pathways
        through all channels of the body. You will conclude the practice with a
        full body free movement exploration to activate your authentic
        expression and allow the transmutation and expression of your luscious
        inner landscape.</p>

  heading: Frequently asked questions
  questions-and-answers:
    - question: I have a busy schedule. Can I take my time working through each module?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>YES! Wisdom Body is designed to serve YOU in living in your radiance.
        Therefore the practices have been designed to give you the freedom of
        when, and how often you practice. That being said here is the
        recommendation from Mana Mei.</p><p>For first time, it is recommended to
        complete ONE module per week, spacing the 3 practices out as you desire.
        The practices are meant to do IN ORDER, as the 3rd practice incorporates
        practice 1 & 2.</p><p>As you have lifetime access, once you have
        completed all 4 modules, you will have the knowledge and freedom to
        revisit specific practices, choosing which will serve you best on any
        particular day.</p><p>These practices are meant to be done MORE THAN
        ONCE. And the more you do them, the deeper you will be able to go.
        Through the practices, you are retraining your ability to stay present,
        to access more freedom, and to evoke new feelings.</p>
    - question: Are there prerequisites to take this program?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>NO. This program is open to any woman who is excited and ready to
        dive into the movement medicine, regardless of your previous experience.
        All women can benefit from this program, regardless of your age,
        physical capacity, dance experience, or location in the world.</p><p>In
        the case that you are still worried that you do not have enough
        experience for this program, Mana Mei recommends starting with the MANA
        Movement Program as a solid starting foundation.</p>
    - question: What is the difference between Wisdom Body and MANA Movement?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>MANA Movement is a guided practice which flows through sequences of
        specific movement patterns that are focused on bringing non-linear
        movement into the physical body, otherwise known as the Feminine
        Pathways or circles, spirals, and waves.</p><p>MANA Movement is a great
        place to start for those who are completely new to embodied dance and
        want clear and specific guidance on how to move the body for more
        freedom.</p><p>Wisdom Body will offer you the next level of freedom in
        that there is no specific guided movements, but rather invitations for
        you to discover your unique movement style through intentional prompts,
        imagery, and somatic cues.</p><p>Wisdom Body is perfect for any woman
        ready to deepen her movement practice and gain new inspiration for
        increased freedom.</p>
    - question: Will I receive a certificate at the end?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Wisdom Body is purely a personal deep dive experience so there is no
        certification at completion. If you are interested in Mana Mei’s Level 1
        Leadership and Facilitator Training, check out the Liberation Through
        Movement Mentorship Program!</p>
    - question: I don’t have a credit card. Is there any other way I can pay?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Yes! We accept PayPal and Bank Transfers. Please contact Mana Mei to
        request a new payment option.</p>
