  description_html: >-
    <p>MANA Movement is a modality of movement that is focused on activating the
    non-linear pathways of energy and of physical movement through the body.
    These pathways are circles, spirals, and waves. These are also called the
    Feminine Pathways of Movement.</p><p>The purpose of this practice is to
    bring our physical body and our energy body back into balance- where we hold
    a harmonious balance between the Masculine and the Feminine. The Masculine
    movement is linear, the feminine movement is non-linear. Because we live in
    a world where we primarily move and function from the Masculine, it is
    important for us to take the time to activate the Feminine in order to come
    back into harmonious balance.</p><p>When we activate these Feminine pathways
    of movement through the body, we allow the natural flow of life force energy
    to move through us without restriction. This will allow us to access more
    creativity, more pleasure, more inspiration, more joy.</p><p>It also allows
    us to meet life’s challenges with more peace and with more grace. It
    increases our capacity to, literally, flow with life. This will bring more
    ease into every single aspect of your life.&nbsp;</p><p>Through this
    practice, by simply focusing on bringing these circles and spirals and waves
    into every single part of your body, this will in turn benefit the way you
    move through life and the way you meet life in every single
    moment.&nbsp;</p>

        the central channel of the body from root to crown, through the spine,
        as well as opening the channels through the arms. You will be introduced
        to the breath-body connection and conscious breathing patterns used
        throughout the practice. You will also have moments to dive into your
